Extracted data under a defined product category from a popular Ecommerce Platform in Hong Kong (HKTV Mall). Various types of extracted product informations were listed as follows: 

"Prodcut name"  
"URL direct to the product details page"  
"Product average rating"  
"Number of comments given to the product"  
"Price per unit (HKD)"  
"Place of origin"

The extracted raw product data was further cleaned by transforming into correct data type. Finally ran a query for returning the result table with the products having the average rating within the stated range, sorting by descending order of number of comments given.
